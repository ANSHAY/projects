A DNN to classify a given image as human or horse.

## Defected vs. healthy
A DNN that classifies a given image as that of a healthy or defected artifact

## Trigger Word Detection
Constructed a speech dataset and implemented an algorithm for trigger word detection (also called keyword detection, or wakeword detection) that allows a system to wake up upon hearing a certain word

## Neural Machine Translation
Built a Neural Machine Translation (NMT) model to translate human readable dates (“25th of June, 2009”) into machine readable dates (“2009-06-25”) using an attention model

## Emojify
Implemented a model which inputs a sentence (such as “Let’s go see the baseball game tonight!”) and finds the most appropriate emoji to be used with this sentence using word vector representations

## Music Generation with LSTM
Implemented a model using LSTM to generate Jazz music

## Dinosaur Island – Character level language model
Built a character level language model to randomly generate new dinosaur names based on names learned from a dataset of dinosaur names

## Face Detection with CNN
Implemented triplet loss function and performed face verification and face recognition using 128D encodings generated with a pre-trained ConvNet model
