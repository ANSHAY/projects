## Open3D
An Api for Open3D which returns a list of identically colored connected components grouped together based on their color in a mesh of connected vertices.

## Telegram
### Muxxer
An Api written in python that collects messages and posts from multiple channels and converges them to one single channel. A very useful api in cases where a user has to join large number of channels. This api removes the need of joining multiple channels while bringing the content at one place.

### Channelmuxbot
A telegram bot that helps Muxxer by adding and removing channels in a list of channels. It provides a clean interface to the user to make it easy to add/remove channels.

## Sound Localization
Designed and performed a complete experiment to study the degree to which people can localize a source of sound among normal, blind, and patients treated for blindness.

## Isolated Digit Recognition using HMMs
Designed a speech recognition system using HMMs that can recognize digits from 0 to 9 spoken by the user.

## Automatic collision prevention system
Designed a system that prevents collision of vehicles by monitoring other vehicles on road relative to the user’s vehicle with the help of multiple sensors mounted on the vehicle.

## Thermal Video Stabilization
To efficiently estimate and correct motion in a thermal video using Harris Corner detector and Lucas-Kanade method.

## Biometric door locking and unlocking system
Designed a system to lock and unlock using finger print scanner and microcontroller with the facility of multiple finger print recognitions.

## Automatic switching of lights
Designed a circuit that switches on the lights of a room when a person enters the room and switches them off when the room is empty. It also counts the number of people present in the room at a time.

## Alcohol detector based ignition control system
Designed a control system that controls the ignition of a vehicle based on the alcohol level detected. If the driver is drunk, the system will prevent the vehicle from starting. It was designed for the “TI MCU DESIGN CONTEST 2012”.

## Analysis of behavior of Air Horn (Acoustics)
Analyzed the behavior of an air horn and its contribution in improving the performance of a driver including how an airhorn is able to produce high levels of amplitude without active amplification of the sound. Also studied different shapes of air-horn and which shape results in most efficient output and why.

## Quadrature Amplitude Multiplexer
Designed a circuit to successfully transmit and receive two message signals by using Quadrature Amplitude Multiplexing. The circuit was constructed on TI Analog Design kit.
