      <h4>Motor Imagery based classification of EEG data</h4>
      <p>Executed a project on Brain Computer Interfacing (BCI) at IIT Delhi in which the EEG signal recorded from the scalp of a subject was acquired and processed using signal processing, machine learning and other techniques to control a virtual scenario (moving a ball in a scene in this case) based on the motor Imagery data from a subject.
      I designed and coded the simulation program in pygame which displays Right and Left arrow at short random intervals. I also recruited and prepared subjects for EEG recording, performed the setup for scalp preparation like setting the EEG cap, electrode attachment and impedence checking, etc. I trained the model from the data in MATLAB using EEGLAB and BCILAB.
      The subjects were asked to think about moving their left or right hand based on the arrow on the screen. The EEG was recorded during these tasks, which was then filtered and processed and trained upon to build a model
